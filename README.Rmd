The [University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php) contains 602 data sets as of 2022. These datasets are especially good for machine learning practice, and can be used to create reproducible code examples. As of December, 2019, there are 488 available datasets.

The challenge with using the repository is that understanding how to get the data into R isn't always intuitive and is inaccessible for beginners. `readUCI` helps make this process easier. `read_UCI` facilitates the process of importing data from the University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository.


## Installation

You can install the package through GitHub:

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
#devtools::install_github("emmal73/readUCI")

library(readUCI)
```


## Data sets

### `UCI_datasets`

The dataset `UCI_datasets` has all of the available data sets from the repository and some characteristics, including data types and common tasks to perform with that data. 

```{r}
head(UCI_datasets)
```

### `args_UCI`

The dataset `args_UCI` provides the user with the arguments needed to import data from the UCI repository using the read_UCI function. This includes the link to the data set in the repository, and the dataset webpage.

```{r}
head(args_UCI)
```

### Common Use: `read_UCI`

`read_UCI` is used to import data from the UCI machine learning repository into R. 

![Abalone](inst/abalone_annotated.jpg)

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
abalone <- read_UCI("abalone", "abalone.data")
head(abalone)
```

## Common Use: `search_UCI`

`search_UCI` allows the user to filter `UCI_datasets` by data type, machine learning task, field of study, and minimum instances. This helps search through `UCI_datasets` and limit the data entries to show datasets that relevant to the user.

```{r}
search_UCI("Multivariate", "Classification", "Life Sciences", 500)
```

## Additional Functionality

* `preview_names`: Shows whether imported data includes variable names, and adds variable names to imported data.
* `test_train_split`: Splits datasets into test and training data. Outputs are a test and train input and a test and train output dataset

## Additional Datasets

For your convenience, 9 datasets from the UCI database have been imported and cleaned with the package. These are:

* `adult`: used to predict whether income is greater than $50K from census data
* `flags`: contains details of countries and their flags
* `las_vegas`: contains features of online reviews of 21 hotels in Las Vegas
* `tictactoe`: used for binary classification, based on possible tic-tac-toe configurations
* `wine`: used to determine origin of wines based on chemical analysis
* `breast_cancer`: used to predict presence of breast cancer from real patient data obtained from the Institute of Oncology, Ljubljanadetermine
* `car`: useful for testing constructive induction and structure discovery method on car evaluation
* `glass`: useful for identifying glass content, from the USA forensic science service
* `liver`: useful to identify liver disorders
